	{		title: "Barcelona 3-3 Man City highlights and reaction as Riyad Mahrez rescues dramatic late draw",

		description: "3-3 is how the match ends! As friendlies go that was a pretty entertaining one. City took the lead through a rather fortuatous Julian Alvarez goal, before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang drew Barcelona level. Memphis Depay strikes either side of a Cole Palmer tap-in looked to have sealed the win for Barca, but an emphatic late penalty from Riyad Mahrez ensured that the game finished all-square. City's players got the run out that Guardiola wanted, but there will be an anxious wait to find out the severity of Luke Mbete's head injury.

		description: "Everton are hopeful a deal can be struck in time for him to face his former club Brentford on Saturday but there is still some work to do to complete negotiations before midday on Friday. The Toffees have already shown an interest in Southampton's Che Adams this week. One source has told Sky Sports the deal under discussion would value Adams at up to £25m. Maupay scored eight goals for the Seagulls last season, but is yet to start a league game for the club this term with Danny Welbeck favoured in attack." ,

Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo was brutally axed in front of the whole Manchester United squad during a two-hour summit meeting, SunSport reveals. And United are said to be ready to go back in for Sergino Dest of Barcelona, as they look for a right-back to replace Aaron Wan-Bissaka. The Dutch-American, who worked with Erik ten Hag at Ajax, is said to consider Old Trafford to be a dream move.",

Now he is seeking to build on that impressive display against Jurgen Klopp's men when United travel to St Mary's to take on Southampton on Saturday lunchtime. And Ten Hag could be seen being dropped off by his partner Bianca just 24 hours before the clash on the south coast. United stars Jadon Sancho and Anthony Martial were also spotted arriving at the club's Carrington training ground.",

Cristiano Ronaldo's representative Jorge Mendes has approached Napoli over a potential move.Mendes is working hard to find Ronaldo the solution he wants - to play in the Champions League - but also to provide a solution for United, which is a replacement. Napoli, however, would only accept a triple-digit offer for Osimhen and it is difficult to see how United could afford him with the money they are prepared to commit to buying Antony from Ajax.",

		title: "Fantasy Premier League LIVE! GW4: Team news, injury updates and expert advice",

		description: "In our latest column, Holly Shand, FPL Heisenberg and FPL Family - who between them have ten top 10k finishes and more than 30 years of Fantasy experience - discuss what their wildcard teams would look like and who their captain is for the week. James Ward-Prowse (£6.5m) has blanked in only one of the first three GWs, scoring against Spurs and supplying an assist against Leicester to total 18 points. If you are looking to bring in a goalkeeper, Brighton's Robert Sanchez (£4.5m) is my preference because they have a solid defence and a favourable run of fixtures. Another good cheap goalkeeper with favourable fixtures is Brentford's David Raya (£4.5m). : I too have Sanchez and I'm thinking of sticking with him. Brighton have been excellent defensively so far this season, only conceding one goal. Only Man City and Arsenal have a better xGC (expected goals conceded), which means their defensive performances so far - and the FPL points Sanchez is getting - should continue, assuming they keep it up.",
